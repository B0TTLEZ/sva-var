# Prompts for Phase 1: Semantic Role Labeling
# ==============================================================================
semantic_role_labeling: |
  You are an expert Senior Hardware Architect. Your task is to analyze a list of signals from a Verilog module and assign a semantic role to each.
  The analysis should be based on the signal's name, direction, and whether it's identified as a control variable.

  Here are the available roles:
  - **Control:** General control signals (e.g., clocks, resets, enables).
  - **Configuration:** Static or semi-static signals that configure the module's behavior (e.g., mode, settings).
  - **Status:** Signals that report the internal state of the module (e.g., busy, done, error_flag, FSM states).
  - **Request:** Signals used to request access to a resource.
  - **Grant:** Signals used to grant access to a resource.
  - **Data:** Signals that carry primary data or payload.
  - **Internal:** Internal registers or wires not directly interfacing outside.

  You will be given a JSON object containing information about multiple signals. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object where keys are the full signal names and values are the assigned semantic role string. Do not include any other text or explanations.

  Analyze these signals:

# Prompts for Phase 2: Causal Reasoning
# ==============================================================================
causal_link_inference: |
  You are a Verilog expert analyzing signal interactions with a deep understanding of hardware causality. Given a driver signal and a load signal, their semantic roles, and their code context, determine the causal relationship.

  **CRITICAL RULE: Causality in hardware is directional. An 'output' or 'internal' signal can NEVER be the cause that affects an 'input' signal. An 'input' is an external cause.**

  - **Driver Signal:** `{driver_signal}` (Role: {driver_role}, Direction: {driver_direction})
  - **Load Signal:** `{load_signal}` (Role: {load_role}, Direction: {load_direction})
  - **Code Context:** `{code_snippet}`

  **Analysis Steps:**
  1.  **Check Physical Causality:** Based on the CRITICAL RULE and signal directions, is a causal link from Driver to Load physically possible? If the Driver is an 'output' and the Load is an 'input', this is impossible.
  2.  **Determine Causal Type:** If physically possible, choose the single most fitting causal link type from this list:
      - **Triggers:** A change in the driver directly causes a state change or action in the load.
      - **Blocks:** The state of the driver prevents an action related to the load.
      - **Enables:** The state of the driver is a necessary precondition for an action on the load.
      - **Statically_Affects:** The driver (usually config) determines the operational mode for the load.
      - **Informs:** The driver provides data to the load.
      - **Resets:** The driver is a reset signal that forces the load to a known state.
  
  **Your Response:**
  - If a causal link is physically impossible, respond with ONLY the string "No_Link".
  - Otherwise, respond with ONLY the chosen link type string (e.g., "Triggers").
